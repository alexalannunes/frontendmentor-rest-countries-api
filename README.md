## My process
First of all, I wanted to develop all the aesthetics of the project, such as layout and colors. Gradually I installed dependencies such as routing and icons. For the development I used a mock to adjust the expectations of the design. At the end of it all, I installed data fetching and caching libraries for a better experience.
